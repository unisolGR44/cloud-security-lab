# Cloud Security Lab 🔐

This repo is my playground for cloud security learning, lab work, and tools. Built with AWS, Terraform, Python, and a love of breaking things safely.

## What's Here:
- 👮 IAM Hardening Policies
- 🔍 CloudTrail Event Parsers for Threat Detection
- 🧱 Terraform templates for secure VPCs
- 🔐 KMS Key Usage Logging
- 🧠 Study notes for AWS Security Speciality

Each project is built from scratch as I deepen my expertise toward a career in Cloud Security Engineering.
